## Elevator pitch

You can tell a lot from a civilization from it's language, and one of the most 
important aspects of language is the words that are used to represent people. A 
name is the essence of a thing, and the trends in child names over the last 
century tell a story about the evolutin of our culture. What were the most 
common names during the Great Depression? What about in the Civil Rights era? 
In this project I will show visualizations that compare the relative prominence 
of names over time, and I will also show how the popularity of names has 
changed over time.

## GRAND QUESTION 1

How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?



```{python}
#| label: GQ1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

dat = pd.read_csv(url)

```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}
#| label: GQ1 chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "My useless chart"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here
alt.Chart(dat.head(200))\
    .encode(x="Scott", y="year")\
    .mark_bar()\
    .properties(
        width=800,
        height=300
    )
```


```{python}
#| label: GQ1 table
#| code-summary: table example
#| tbl-cap: "Not much of a table"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
# Include and execute your code here
mydat = dat.head(1000)\
    .groupby('year')\
    .sum()\
    .reset_index()\
    .tail(10)\
    .filter(["year", "AK","AR"])

display(mydat)

```


## GRAND QUESTION 2

If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of 
his or her age? What ages would you not guess?
