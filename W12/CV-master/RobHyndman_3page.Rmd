# Teaching and mentoring

  * In each year since 2018, student evaluations for "Applied forecasting for business and economics" gave an average rating for my teaching above 4.8 out of 5.
  * I currently supervise five PhD students and two post-doctoral research fellows. I have previously supervised another 27 PhD students and 3 Masters students.
  * I am author of an innovative textbook with George Athanasopoulos entitled *Forecasting: principles and practice* ([`OTexts.org/fpp3/`](https://OTexts.org/fpp3)) which is available online and free of charge. The website has an average of over 20000 pageviews per day.
  * I publish the [*Hyndsight*](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight) blog on research issues which receives an average of about 2000 pageviews per day.
