        "The name 'Scott' showed 26,177 occurrences in the year 1964, with the largest geographic areas of usage in the Mid-west and West. Historically, the name showed minimal usage throughout the 20th century until the 1950's, when it began to appear in popular culture. The greatest spike in usage for 'Scott' appears in the mid-1960's, with the largest years being 1963 - 1966, including my own birth year. There was at least one very popular 'hit' song in 1963 that featured the name prominently, and the name was also used in a popular television show in 1964. The name 'Scott' has been used in popular culture since the 1950's, but it was not until the 1960's that it became a popular name for children. Starting in 1972 - 1973 the name began to decline in popularity, and it has been on a steady decline since then. The name 'Scott' is currently ranked 1,000th in popularity.\n",

The popularity of the names has remained high since the release of the first movie, and has not declined since the release of the last movie in 2019.
